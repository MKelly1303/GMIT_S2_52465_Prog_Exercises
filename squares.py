# Dealing with For Loops
# Mark Kelly S2 - wk1 Recap

#l = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# instead of setting the intial list a range could be used.
#for i in l:
for i in range(100):
  #print(i, i*i)
  print(f"{i:3} {i*i:5}")
  #prints i and the square of i. i has 3 character spaces while i*i has 5. f formats the output++++

print("Thats the full list")
